Would you team up or go solo based on these high stakes? <br><br>2.In the universe of 'The Hunger Games', what are tesserae and what do they offer to the participants in the Harvest?    | And here's where the real interest begins. Suppose you're poor and starving. Then you can ask to be included in the Harvest more times than you're entitled to, and in return you'd get tesserae. They give you grain and oil for a whole year for one tessera per person. You won't be full, but it's better than nothing. You can take tesserae for the whole family. When I was twelve, my name was entered four times. Once by law, and once more for tesserae for Prim, my mother, and myself. The next years had to do the same. And since the price of a tessera increases by one entry each year, now that I've turned sixteen, my name will be on twenty cards. Gale is eighteen, and he's been feeding a family of five for seven years. His name will be entered forty two times! It's clear that people like Madge, who has never had to risk because of tesserae, annoy Gale. Next to us, the inhabitants of the slag heap, she simply has no chance of getting into the games. Well, almost no chance. Of course, the rules are set by the Capitol, not the districts, let alone Madge's relatives, and it's still hard to sympathize with those who, like you, don't have to trade their own skin for a piece of bread.  | 80504cd8-9b21-514c-b001-4761d8c71044         |\n",

Harry was so excited that he could not sit still and paced back and forth across the room, trying to stay as close to the fireplace as possible. He was still shaking with cold.

I sang to her till she fell asleep. Tears well up in my eyes. Will and strength are leaving me. There's only Rue, the pain in my head, fear of Cato and the moan of the dying girl. - Fell asleep? - mocks Cato. - Died. I sang to her till she died - I say. - Your district... sent me bread.

First of all, every district is now at war with the Capitol, except for the second one, which has always been under the patronage of our enemies, despite their participation in the Hunger Games. They received more food and better living conditions. After the Dark Days and the supposed destruction of District 13, District 2 became the new defense center of the Capitol.

There's only Rue, the pain in my head, fear of Cato and the moan of the dying girl. - Fell asleep? - mocks Cato. - Died. I sang to her till she died - I say. - Your district... sent me bread. I raise my hand - not for an arrow; I won't have time anyway. I just blow my nose. - Cato, make it quick, okay? His face shows conflicting emotions. Cato puts down the rock and says with almost a reproach: - This time, only this time, I'm letting you go. For the girl. We are even. No one owes anything to anyone anymore, understand? I nod, because I do understand. Understand about debts. About how bad it is to have them. Understand that if Cato wins, he will return to a district that has forgotten the rules to thank me. And Cato is neglecting them, too. Right now, he's not going to crack my head with a stone.\n"
